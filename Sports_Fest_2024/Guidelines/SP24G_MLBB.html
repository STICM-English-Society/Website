            <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'>
              Teams will compete against each other to destroy the opposing team’s base. They will need to strategize,
              communicate, and work together to outplay their opponents. The gameplay will involve using in-game
              abilities, tactics, and coordination.

              The winning condition is for a team to successfully destroy the opposing team’s base before the other team
              does. The team that achieves this goal first will be declared the winner. Alternatively, if a team
