            Pass the Ball is a high-energy game where two teams of 12 players aim to pass a ball sequentially while
            defusing scattered time bombs. Players must pass the ball cleanly and defuse the bombs within a set time
            limit, showcasing teamwork and coordination. Points are awarded based on successful defusal and completion
            time, creating a thrilling race against the clock with a focus on fair play and sportsmanship.

            <li>The game begins with a designated player from one team holding the ball. Players must pass the ball

                <li>If a player fails to complete the required spinning motion around the time bomb within the
                  designated time limit of 15 seconds, their team incurs a penalty. This violation could result in a
                  deduction of points and additional time added to their completion time.</li>

                <li>Players must remain within the boundaries of the playing area while passing the ball and defusing
                  the time bombs. If a player steps out of bounds, whether intentionally or unintentionally, their team
                  is penalized, and they may need to restart the passing sequence from the beginning.</li>

                <li>Deliberate interference with the opponent's passing sequence, such as blocking passes or disrupting
                  the defusal of time bombs, constitutes a violation of fair play. Teams found guilty of interference
                  may face penalties, including point deductions or disqualification from the game.</li>
