            making it popular worldwide.

            Game Mechanics
          </h2>

          <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'>
            All participants must adhere to the rules and regulations set forth by the STI College Marikina. These rules
            cover various aspects of the game, including player conduct, gameplay regulations, and officiating
            standards. All the players in basketball must join the parade or else they won't be able to play in their
            first game. Also, every 5 minutes or half of a quarter requires a substitute for a new 5 players on the
            court.
            <b>Dribbling</b>
            The team in possession of the ball must advance it toward the opponent's basket by dribbling (bouncing the
            ball while moving) or passing it to teammates. Players can move freely on the court but must dribble the
            ball while moving, except for the designated point guard who can dribble without restriction.
            <b>Shooting and Scoring</b>
            The objective is to score points by shooting the ball into the opponent's basket. The basket is a hoop
            mounted 10 feet above the floor. A field goal, worth two or three points depending on the distance from
            which it's made, is scored when a player successfully shoots the ball through the opponent's hoop. Free
            throws, worth one point each, are awarded for certain fouls and are taken from the free-throw line.
            <b>Defending</b>
            The team without the ball plays defense, trying to prevent the opposing team from scoring. Defenders can
            block shots, steal the ball, or disrupt passes to regain possession.
            <b>Follow game rules</b>
            Basketball has specific rules regarding dribbling, traveling (moving without dribbling), fouls, timeouts,
            and substitutions. Familiarize yourself with these rules to play effectively and fairly. Scorekeeping: Keep
            track of points scored by each team throughout the game. The team with the most points at the end of the
            game wins.
            <b>Enjoy the game</b>
            Basketball is a fast-paced and exciting sport that requires teamwork, skill, and strategy. Have fun
            competing, improving your skills, and working together with your teammates to achieve success on the court.
            <br>
            The rule also encompasses the concept of a "Running Clock Rule" or continuous clock, which applies from the
            first to the third quarter of the game. During this period, the clock runs continuously, without stopping
            for minor interruptions. However, once the fourth quarter begins, this rule no longer applies, and the clock
            stops as usual for timeouts, fouls, and other game-related stoppages.
            <br>
            The coach and team captain are the only authorized individuals to communicate with the committee during the
            game, and other players are strictly prohibited from doing so; failure to adhere to this rule will result in
            a warning issued to the respective team.
            <br>
            The time out for each team is 3 per quarter and the time out for overtime is 2 only every time out at 1
            minute remaining and after that the players must return to the court. Also, when a team commits 5 fouls, a
            penalty will automatically be applied and the other team will have 2 free throws and when a player/ coaches
            has a technical foul, the other team will also have a 1 free throw.
            <br>
            If a player receives two technical fouls, they will be suspended from playing the next game.
          </p>

            How to win
          </h2>

          <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'>
            To succeed in basketball, two teams compete on the court, striving for victory. If the score is tied at the
            end of the 4th quarter, overtime (5mins per overtime) is played until one team gains an advantage and
            emerges as the winner. Each team plays two games, and the team with two wins advances directly to the
            semi-finals. Teams without any wins are eliminated, but ties in standings are resolved using a tiebreaker
            called the quotient system.
            <b>Quotient system</b>
            This system calculates the quotient by dividing the total points earned by a team by the number of games
            they have played. It means if all the team ties in the standings we will calculate all the scores played by
            the team in the 1st and 2nd game and whoever is the highest there will play in the semi-finals.
          </p>

          <h2 class='Article_Content_Title'>
            Do's and don'ts
          </h2>

          <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'>
          <ul>
            <li>DO wear proper uniform inside the court.</li>
            <li>DO establish game time expectations and stick to them. For example, if a player is late or if a player
              did not join to parade and you've established that a late player doesn't play in the first game of his
              team, then don't let them play in the first game even if they're your star player. </li>
            <li>DO bench players for inappropriate behavior during a game. Inappropriate behavior on your team would be
              pushing a player, yelling at a referee, yelling at the crowd.</li>
            <li>DO substitute the 5 players inside the court when half time of the quarter arrives.</li>
            <li>DON’T yell at the referees or the officials. This gives your players permission to yell at them and it
              sets a bad example. Everyone, including referees, make mistakes. They're doing their best. If you disagree
              with a call, talk to the referee the way you would expect to be talked to if you made a mistake.</li>
            <li>DON’T commit fouls repeatedly avoid committing unnecessary fouls, especially reaching fouls or fouls
              away from the ball because we’re here to enjoy the game.</li>
            <li>DON’T let players get away with not doing their best. If your players are not giving 100% of themselves,
              then bench them until they're ready it means if the player supporting their enemies to win, he will be
              benched and will not play again.</li>
          </ul>
