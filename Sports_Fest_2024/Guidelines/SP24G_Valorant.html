              This tournament is for the game Valorant, a popular competitive first-person shooter. Teams will compete
              against each other in matches to showcase their skills, teamwork, and strategy.
            </p>

            <h2 class='Article_Content_Title'>
              Team/Player Composition
            </h2>

            <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'>
              Each team should consist of 5 main players and 1 reserved player. All team members should be students of
              STI College Marikina.
            </p>

            <h2 class='Article_Content_Title'>
              Type of Tournament
            </h2>

            <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'>
              Single Elimination with a fair randomizer
            <ul>
              <li>This means that teams will compete in a bracket-style format, where each match is a direct
                elimination. Once a team loses a match, they will be eliminated from the tournament.</li>
              <li>The matchups in the early rounds of the tournament will be randomized, ensuring that teams face
                different opponents in each round. This randomization helps create a fair and unpredictable tournament
                experience, where any team has a chance to succeed. The team that emerges as the winner of the final
                match will be declared the overall champion of the tournament. </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

                Own peripherals
                <ul>
                  <li>Participants may bring their own peripherals, such as their own keyboard, mouse, mousepad, and

                  <li>
                    The use of routers or any internet sharing devices, including mobile hotspots, is not allowed.
                  </li>
                  <li>This rule is to ensure that each player has an independent and dedicated internet connection,
                    which helps maintain a smooth gameplay experience for everyone.</li>

              How to play

            <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'>
            <ul>
              <li>A map will be chosen randomly, and teams will proceed to play heads or tails to determine which team
                plays as the attacker or defender.
              </li>
              <li>The game mode will be Standard, and the lobby setup will be a 5 vs. 5 custom game.</li>
              <li>Players must adhere to the rules and regulations of the game, including not playing under another
                player’s account or Riot ID and not using hacks or third-party programs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class='Article_Content_Title'>
              How to win
            </h2>

            <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'>
              The winning conditions depend on the specific match. However, in the finals, if there is a tie at 12:13,
              the game will continue until one team has a 2-round lead over the other.
            </p>

            <h2 class='Article_Content_Title'>
              Do's and Don'ts

              </li>
              <li>Disconnected players have a limited time to reconnect, or the team may have to continue playing
                without them.</li>
              <li>Lag issues can be addressed during the prep phase, and if not resolved within a certain time frame,
                the team may need to continue playing with the current state.</li>
              <li>In the event of a server crash, the game can be continued from a new draft, but the lineup must remain
                the same.</li>
              <li>If you are using an internet connection for the game and it gets disconnected or lost, the game will
                need to be restarted.</li>
