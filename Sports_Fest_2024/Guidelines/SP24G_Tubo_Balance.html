            Tubo Balance pits ten players in a race to delicately balance a plastic tube on their index finger and be
            the first to stand it upright atop a central pole. Divided into teams, players relay the tube between poles
            while adhering to strict rules prohibiting any contact beyond a single finger. With precision, strategy, and
            teamwork, competitors navigate the challenge, aiming for the triumphant moment of tube-on-pole perfection.
