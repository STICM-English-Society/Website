					Directed by Reniel Baldove, he and Aerol Jacob Epino begins shooting the video as Mark Darryl Matandag interviews them. They were asked about what they felt during the disaster. One of the victims said that they were traumatized by the incident, unable to move and think as she were unable to save any stuff from her house. Another shared the same sentiment, as she says that her mind went blank at that moment. They were grateful that their Barangay Captain supported them as foods were given to them as they stay at the evacuation area.
