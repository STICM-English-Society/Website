        The Bureau of Internal Revenue 
        </h2> 
       
        <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'> 
        The Bureau of Internal Revenue, also known as the Kawanihan ng Rentas Internas, or BIR, is the department of the Philippine Government that is solely focused on collecting and managing the revenues of the government from taxes and other sources of income of the government. The BIR has existed between the many eras of Philippine History, from the Spanish colonial period up to the present day. In this article, we’ll dive into the three latest eras of BIR’s history, from the American to the Post-War Era.

        The American Era (1898 - 1946) 
        </h2> 
       
        <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'> 
        In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Philippines underwent major transformations under American rule. The American presence began with military leaders in 1898, followed by the establishment of the first civil government in 1902 under William H. Taft. A key development during this time was the creation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) in 1904 through the Reorganisation Act No. 1189. The BIR, starting operations on August 1, 1904, was overseen by Secretary of Finance Henry Ide and led by its first Commissioner, John S. Hord, along with a team of 69 staff members in various roles. Initially led by American collectors, such as Hord, Ellis Cromwell, William T. Holting, and James J. Rafferty, the BIR underwent its first reorganization in 1913 under Collector William T. Holting, establishing eight divisions with specific functions. President William McKinley's Filipinization policy influenced the BIR to appoint Filipino Collectors, marking a significant shift in leadership. Wenceslao Trinidad, Juan Posadas, Jr., and Alfredo Yatao were the initial Filipino appointees between 1918 and 1938.
        
        </p> 
       
        <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'> 
        In 1921, Act No. 299 streamlined the BIR's operations to five divisions, aligning with the Filipinization efforts. Throughout its early years, the BIR underwent minor adjustments, including the establishment of the Examiner's Division and the later abolition of the Secret Service Section in 1951. The organization maintained a consistent structure from 1921 to 1941, with slight changes like the addition of the Miscellaneous Tax Division in 1939. A significant development occurred in 1937 with Regulation No. 95, restructuring Provincial Inspection Districts to enhance efficiency at the provincial level. Each province was designated to have its own Internal Revenue Office overseen by a Provincial Agent.

        The Japanese Era (1942 - 1945) 
        </h2> 
       
        <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'> 
        During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the Japanese imperial army established various systems that involved taxes. The Japanese implemented these taxes in order to fund their war efforts and expenses.  Taxes such as land tax, business tax, and war contribution tax were implemented during that time. The Japanese have collected these taxes in order to extract resources from the Philippine economy in order to make use of these funds for Japanese war machinery. They also introduced various economic policies that aimed to take away the manpower that the Philippines use for wartime needs. The Bureau was combined with the Customs office and was headed by a Director of Customs and Internal Revenue during the outbreak of World War II under the Japanese regime.

        The Post-War Era (1946 onwards) 
        </h2> 
       
        <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'> 
        On July 4, 1946, the Philippines gained its independence from the United States. As a result, the Bureau was separately re-established. Executive Order No. 94 went into effect on October 1, 1947, which reorganised the government.  The reorganisation and expansion of BIR also included the creation of 3 new departments: Legal; Assessment; and Collection, the implementation of the withholding tax system, and decentralization through the establishment of regional offices in Cebu; and Davao in July of 1955 and continued expansion to 10 regional offices in 1957.
        
        </p> 
       
        <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'> 
        That same year, the position title of the head changed from Collector to Commissioner. The BIR continued to take steps toward its reorganization in the following years, the Tax Census Division was created with the intention of compiling financial information, and the Rewards Law was enacted to compel tax payments and deter tax evasion.

        <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'> 
        Under Commissioner Misael Vera's direction in 1965, the tax administration system went into considerable modifications during the Marcos Administration. Prominent initiatives such as the "Blue Master Program" and the "Voluntary Tax Compliance Program" were put in place to deal with misconduct on the part of BIR employees and taxpayers. Along with the establishment of numerous new offices, the nation was further split into 90 Revenue District Offices and 20 Regional Offices.
        
        </p> 
       
        <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'> 
        The Bureau's improved performance in collecting taxes was mainly due to important initiatives like giving taxpayers a permanent Tax Account Number (TAN), letting tax payments through banks, and allowing the industry to perform package audit investigations. Tax amnesty decrees were issued in response to the declaration of martial law in 1972. The National Internal Revenue Code of 1977 and organisational reorganisations also had an impact on the Bureau's operations.

        In order to enhance tax administration, the Philippines' Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) underwent substantial changes following the People's Revolution in February 1986. The goal of "Operation: Walang Lagay" is to encourage truthful tax collection. Two main functional groups were established when Commissioner Bienvenido Tan, Jr. reorganised the BIR in 1987. 
        </p> 
       
        <p class='Article_Content_Paragraph'> 
        Following the introduction of the value-added tax (VAT) in 1988, a campaign started to promote compliance. The Revenue Information Systems Services Inc. (RISSI) was returned to the BIR that same year. The "Tax Administration Programme" was introduced by Commissioner Jose Ong in 1989 with an emphasis on streamlining and improving tax collection. The country's tax administration efficiency and fairness were the goals of these initiatives.

        Liwayway Vinzons-Chato was appointed as the first female Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service in 1993. The Bureau was able to bring the organisation into line with its vision and mission through the implementation of the Action-Centered Transformation Programme (ACTS) under her direction. A five-year Tax Computerization Project (TCP) was started in 1994 to create an advanced Internal Administration System and Integrated Tax System. Through EO No.430, which was implemented in 1997, the BIR was further streamlined. This resulted in the establishment of the Legal and Enforcement Group as well as several support services, including the Internal Affairs Service and Revenue Data Centres.

        Beethoven Rualo was appointed Commissioner of Internal Revenue during the presidency of President Estrada. Prominent reform initiatives were put into place, like the ERAP Program, which granted immunity to taxpayers who paid 20% more in taxes than in 1997. Reception demands were raised by the "Humingi ng Resibo, Manalo ng Libo-Libo" promotion. The Large Taxpayers Monitoring System was founded by Rualo. When Dakila Fonacier took over as Commissioner in the year 2000, she put the compliance of taxpayers first. Compromise settlement program, electronic stamp tax metering, and tax computerization were among the measures. To support tax campaigns, agreements were forged with various organisations. Established were the Excise Taxpayers Service and the Large Taxpayers Service. A fully integrated tax system was put into place by the bureau.
